An old Chinese saying goes: **Road to Jane**

古人有云：**大道至简**

so...

### RTFC

[Amigo](https://github.com/eleme/amigo) has opened source code in github, so everyone has access to it;

and we use **Apache License v2.0** as amigo's license, so everyone can use & modify it.

### usage

```groovy
 classpath 'me.ele:amigo:0.0.3'
 ...

 apply plugin: 'me.ele.amigo'
 ...
```

you are good to go now, as simple as this.

### if you don't need hotfix work immediately

you just need to download new apk file to /data/data/{your pkg}/files/amigo/demo.apk,
when app restarts next time, hotfix apk will be loaded as fresh as new.

```java
File hotfixApk = Amigo.getHotfixApk(context);
```

### work immediately, app will restart immediately

```java
Amigo.work(context);

Amigo.work(context, apkFile);
```

### maybe hotfix needs to be cleared

```java
Amigo.clear(context);
```

### some time-tense operation is handled in a new process with an activity, you may customize it

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="amigo_layout"
    android:value="{your-layout-name}" />

<meta-data
    android:name="amigo_theme"
    android:value="{your-theme-name}" />

```

### now Amigo support to load new Activity and BroadcastReceiver

you can add activities & receivers whatever you like to add in your hotfix apk,
waiting for **Service** & **ContentProvider**

if you would like to RTFC, please checkout **support_new_added_components** branch

this's in **beta** version for now, so you may use this

```groovy
 classpath 'me.ele:amigo:0.0.1-beta1'
 ...

```

### play with demo 

if you try to experience Amigo's magic, you can integrate with your own app as you like;
also you can play with this app demo following the procedures below.

  - gradle clean assembleRelease & adb install .../build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk

  - change code wherever you like & gradle clean assembleRelease
  
  - adb push .../build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk /sdcard/demo.apk
  
  - kill Amigo demo by yourself & restart to check if your change works
